# Sorted Photography
After coming back from a trip with many dslr photos, I started backing them up on Google Drive. Soon later I realized I should be uploading photos and videos to Google Photos, not Google Drive, as Photos would show each image already rendered on the screen in Instagram-style whereas Drive would require clicking each image to view in fullscreen. Migrating them over seemed to sometimes change the exif data, as images I was uploading to an album in Photos were placed out of order. I made this program to help rename and organize my jpg and mov assets, to be placed in Google Photos albums.

### Requirements
1. node v21.0.0

### Run locally
1. `npm install`
2. Move to-be-converted pics/vids to a "Photos" folder in root
2. `npm run sort`
